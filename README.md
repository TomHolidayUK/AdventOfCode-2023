# AdventOfCode-2023

My first attempt at AoC, let's see how it goes...
I will be using Typescript
Edit: For some I will use Python, because I felt rusty with Python and wanted some practice

Notes:
Day 8, part 2: I had to check on reddit to see the clue of using LCM's
Day 12: I felt completely lost after looking at it for a few days and had to check reddit and youtube
Day 17 - Part 1: I managed to apply Dijkstra's but it didn't account for moving in the same direction for more than 3 consecutive move. So I has to look at an online solution for inspiration
Day 18 - needed to look online to see the trick about using Shoelace theory and Pick's theorem to complete part 2
