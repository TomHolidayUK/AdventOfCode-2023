# AdventOfCode-2023

My first attempt at AoC, let's see how it goes...
I will be using Typescript
Edit: For some I will use Python, because I felt rusty with Python and wanted some practice

Notes:
Day 8, part 2: I had to check on reddit to see the clue of using LCM's
Day 12: I felt ocmpletely lost after looking at it for a few days and had to check reddit and youtube
